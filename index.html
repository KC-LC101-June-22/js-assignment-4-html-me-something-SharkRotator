              <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
              <p>I grew up in Los Angeles, CA. Most would consider it one of the best cities to live. It has beautiful beaches,
               people, and views that are not seen anywhere else in the country or world. I lived about 10 minutes from hollywood
               and if you were to look straight down one of my main streets you could see the sign! Los Angeles is a place I will always call 
               home becuase it has left me with many great memories that I carry with me today. It has been a place where I was fortunate enough
               to experience a lot of diversity that has made me understand that people are unique in their own way.

               <h2>Career</h2>
               <p>I am currently working as an engineer in Kansas City, MO. I have been living here for 5 years now and I have enjoyed my experience here.
                  I have always enjoyed math and science as a kid but never would have thought that I would be in the career that I am in today. Seeing things systematically
                  has become a part of my experience as an engineer. Everything has a system, wheter it be complex or simple. They determine the functionality of things and are important
                  to understand if you want to change it.
